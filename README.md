# FinalProject
During this tutorial, I will be explaining use of the Google Earth Engine Code editor to map and calculate Co2 changes in China during the Covid Lockdowns of 2020.  
When importing this dataset, I looked at a few countries and regions before choosing which boundary to focus on. I decided to settle on China for this section 
of code because according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, they are the largest contributor to CO2 emissions in the world with 28% contribution according to 2020 stats. 

The data comes from Copernicus, the European Unions Earth Observation program and provides high-resolution imagery of CO2 concentrations around the 
world collected from the Sentinel 5P TROPOMI satellite.
